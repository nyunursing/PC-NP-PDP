What do you think of my observations?”  The best way to begin the conversation with students who are not following performance standards of care, is to begin with a statement that is an objective in observation of what you, the Clinical Educator, saw the student do or not do in the clinical setting. Answer A provides a succinct summary for the student of what was observed both for this one child and for her overall performance in the clinical setting. Also, the Clinical Educator begins with “I saw” which is considered a direct observation and non-threatening way of talking with the student permitting and permitting the student to reflect on his/her actions in the clinical setting.
